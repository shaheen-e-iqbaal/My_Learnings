1. Adaptive or dynamic routing algorithms -> routing tables gets updated based on the present conditions of the network and it's traffic.
2. Non adaptive or static routing algorithms -> ones the routing tables built, routing of packets happens based on that table. table doesn't updated based on current network conditions.
3. Hybrid routing algorithms -> they are the combination of both adaptive and non adaptive algorithms. they can be classified further as 1. Distance vector 2. Link State.

Distance vector : in this algo., router calculates distances to every possible destination based on its immediate neighbors only, the routerâ€™s routing table is shared with routers that are directly connected with it i.e. it's neighbors, during regular intervals. Bellman ford algo. is used to calculate distances. 

-> count to infinity problem occurs in Distance vector method.


Link State : in this algo., the router shares it's routing table to all the router present in network also  learns from all of them. Dijkstra's algorithm is used.
