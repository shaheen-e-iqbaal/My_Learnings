
-> Input given from terminal are by default string. so if we give int, then also it will be treated as string. so we have to convert string to int using int() function.

-> to convert int to string : str(a)

-> to convert string to int : int(s)

->print() function automatically gets to new line. so to print in the same line :

		print("hello", end = ' ')
		print('World')

	output : hello World
