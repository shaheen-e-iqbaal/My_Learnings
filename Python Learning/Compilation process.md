-> Python is interpreted, dynamic language.

-> Java is both compiled + interpreted, static language.

-> Python  code does't need to compile separately. when we write "python filename.py", It automatically does compilation and interpretation.

-> while in java, we need to first compile the .java file, and then run the .class file.

-> python compiler also generates a .pyc (byte code) file after compiling .py file.  this .pyc file is then given to the PVM (python virtual machine), which will  be then interpreted line by line or instruction by instruction.
