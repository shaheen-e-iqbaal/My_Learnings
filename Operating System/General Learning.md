what is Linux and GNU/Linux :

-> Earlier there is one OS called UNIX which is developed by AT&T company which was paid. so due it's paid nature, the software engineer named Richard stallman felt bad. because he believed that OS like software should be free to make computer more affordable. so to provide free alternative to UNIX, he started Free Software Foundation, under which he and various other engineers contributed to build UNIX like OS called GNU. they developed almost all components of OS like shell, file system etc, but they were not able to develop kernel. so due to this the whole GNU project got stalled. after some time around in 1990's, a engineer named Linux Torvalds developed kernel named Linux which he made open source. which filled the gap of kernel in GNU project. so now the fully fledged GNU/Linux OS was ready which by time known as Linux OS.

### **What is GNU?**

**GNU** (**G**NUâ€™s **N**ot **U**nix) is a free and open-source operating system that is **Unix-like but not Unix**. It was designed to provide users with a **completely free alternative** to proprietary Unix systems.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Purpose of GNU**

- To create a **fully free** software ecosystem.
- To allow users to **run, modify, share, and distribute software** without restrictions.
- To replace proprietary Unix systems with a **free alternative**.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Who Started GNU?**

- **Founder:** **Richard Stallman**
- **Organization:** **Free Software Foundation (FSF)**
- **Year Started:** **1983**

->Richard Stallman launched the **GNU Project** with the vision of a fully free operating system and founded the **FSF (Free Software Foundation)** in 1985 to support this mission.

-> GNU doesn't have it's own stable kernel, so it uses Linux kernel developed by Linus Torvalds. Due to this, GNU based OS also called Linux OS.

-> There are multiple GNU/Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Kali Linux etc.
each distribution has it's own purpose.

-> the shell used by GNU/Linux OS is called bash, which stands for 'Bourne again shell'. which was developed by Brian Fox for the GNU project. it is developed as an free alternative to the bash shell of UNIX developed by Stephen Bourne at AT&T.

Primary vs Secondary memory and RAM vs ROM :

-> primary is a type of memory which is used to store temporary information while program is being run. this type of memories are directly accessible by CPU. ex : RAM, Cache memory etc.

-> They are much faster compared to secondary memory.

-> They are most of the time Volatile in nature. 

-> ROM is also primary memory although it is non volatile in nature. the reason for it being primary memory is because it is directly accessible by CPU and it stores information which is used by CPU during system startup.

-> the size of ROM compared to RAM is vary small.

-> Secondary memory are the memory which used to store the large amount of data permanently. ex : HDD, SSD, CD/DVD, pen drive etc.

-> Secondary memory is managed by OS. they are much slower than primary memory.
-> Secondary memory is not directly accessible by the CPU.
