Features of Java 8 : Functional Interface, Lambda Expression, Stream API, Default and static methods inside Interface, forEach() method inside Iterable Interface, Date Time API. 

-> Basically java 8 enabled functional programming through Stream API, Lambda Expression.

When to use abstract class and Interface :

-> When we have something common through Inheritance relation, then use abstract class. i.e. when we have IS-A relationship.

-> when we have something common but not through inheritance but due to some randomness, then we can use interface.

-> when we have to achieve multiple inheritance, then also use interface.

-> when we have some common instance variables, but their value can get changed in child class, then we can use abstract class. because interface variables are final, so they can't be changed.

Which sorting algorithms are used by Java to sort Primitive, Objects.

-> To sort primitive, Java uses Dual pivot Quick sort. 

-> To sort objects, it uses TimSort which is combination of Merge sort + insertion sort.

-> merge sort guarantees sorting in nlogn and is also a stable. while insertion sort is good for small datasets.
