The Hierarchy of Java is :

JDK : 

Java Development Kit. it is combination of JRE and Compiler, Debugger etc.
Using JDK we can write, compile and debug java Program.


JRE : 

Java Runtime Environment. it is made of a JVM + java Libraries like Java.lang, Java.util.
Using Only JRE, we can run over java Bytecode. we cant compile or write java program.

JVM : 

 1. Java Virtual Machine. It is responsible to convert the Bytecode generated by compiler to Machine code.
2. JIT (Just In Time) is also a part of JVM. it is used to increase the performance of java program by converting bytecode into machine code at run time.
3. Due to JVM, Java is called platform independent. because jvm only requires bytecode, so we can compile java code on any device and can give that bytecode to any different device, which has jvm installed.



JDK = JRE + compiler, debugger etc.

JRE = JVM + Java Libraries like Java.lang, Java.util...


Java Code (.java) ---------> Compiler (.class) -------> JVM ----------> Machine Code
